# AlphaZero Chess Engine

This repository contains an implementation of a chess engine based on the AlphaZero algorithm. The goal of this project is to develop a self-learning AI that can play chess at a high level using deep reinforcement learning techniques.

# Features

Neural network-based evaluation function

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for decision-making

Self-play training using reinforcement learning

No reliance on human-crafted heuristics or opening books

# Installation


# To-Do

Optimize speed of self-play

Design training algorithm

Optimize neural network architecture

Add GUI for visualization
